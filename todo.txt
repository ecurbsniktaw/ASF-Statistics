To Do for ASF Stats
===================

- Expand README.md

-----------------------------------------------------
Changes for next Version:

 - Refactor read_df_from_csv()

- Check chat for other display option ideas

 - New displays to add:
	- All stories published under pen names.
	- All pen names used.
	- All one-story authors.
	- Yr/mo of first appearance of each author (and last?)
	- Table of authors with data, e.g.:
	  . birth & death years and places
	  . brief bio, or link to it
	  . links to detailed online info (wikipedia, etc.)

- Pen names to handle: 
	. Wesley Long is a pen name for George O. Smith. 
  	  There are 6 stories by Long (in 44 and 45).
  	. One author appears with two different name spellings:
  	  Coppel, Alfred & Coppel, Alfred, Jr.
  	. John Pierce; John R. Pierce; J. J. Coupling

- When downloading a spreadsheet, if it has been filtered (e.g. stories
  for just one author are being displayed) download just the filtered rows.

- Change the stacked bar chart to a line plot (?)

- Add 1st, last year to heading of plot of stories by one author.

- In Author Totals table, make the columns more narrow.

- In Authors by month table, make the author column wider.

- Consider finding a way to recognize serials as one story.

- Add some sort of contact-me feature for people to
  ask questions, make suggestions, report errors.

  python/streamlit:

  Or maybe use a free mailing list product like this:

  Or maybe don't send emails, but just write contact-us data to a db that I manually check?

=============================================================
						D O N E
=============================================================

√ For horizontal bar chart: is now for top 20 authors.
  Make it variable: choose number, with 20 as the default.

√ Turn grid on for stacked bar chart.

√ Change stacked bar chart: ask for number of authors to
  show (now uses top 10)

√ Multi author plot:
	√ create fcn to display dl button
	√ add download button
	√ add startup text for multiplot, with 3-author sample output

√ Implement the select authors option.
  Start with the code in ASFcompareAuthors.py

√ Add an "about" option that re-displays the start-up page.

√ Add heading to each display option (because there is no
generic heading being displayed now).

√ In plot-one-author, change the heading text style to the
same used for the start-of-app about text.

√ On startup, don't show full listing. Instead, show
	detailed about text, explaining where the data came
	from, how to use the interactive DataTables output,
	etc. Do this as html code.

√ When plot 1 author is chosen, but before an author
has been picked, show the existing text, but expand it
in general, and in particular, display an example plot,
maybe for Heinlein.

√ Deploy 1st version
  √ Push current code to github
  √ Test the deployed version

√ Read the two csv files from urls instead of from local files
  (and instead of using AWS storage).

√ pen names to process:
	Will F. Jenkins = Murray Leinster
	long list of SF pen names:
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_science-fiction_authors
	this might be a larger list:
	http://www.scifi.darkroastedblend.com/2007/08/authors-pseudonyms.html
	The routine that creates the allStories csv (and handles pen names):

√ In csv dl: author counts needs to be sorted desc on count
  (same for counts by author/year)
  Maybe stop telling DataTables to sort the data, and just
  sort it while still as a dataframe?

√ Provide download button for tables.

√ For plot by year, one author:
  √ Make all years appear, including when there are zero stories
  √ When no author has been chosen, display a help message.
  √ Eliminate the duplicates in the list: should just
  	be a list of the unique author names (right now has
  	one item for every story)
  √ Ask for the author to use
    √ Show full list as a drop down menu?
  √ Provide a button for downloading the plot to a PDF file

√ Implement top 20 authors.

√ When page first appears, show the full list (before any option
  is chosen).

√ Add a title with stats: # stories, # authors, # issues

√ Implement by year, one author.

√ Try (again) generating the pivot table from the all-stories
  table, instead of reading the pivot csv file. 
  => Didn't work... leaving it as is (reading the file)

√ Implement stacked bar chart.

√ First version: local only
	√ Read the csv from a local file
	√ Extract some/all of the analysis code used in the earlier project.
	√ In the left-side panel, drop down menu:
		- Table: Full listing
		- Table: Author counts
		- Table: Author pivot
		- Plot: Stacked bar chart
		- Plot: By Year, 1 Author
		- Plot: Select authors
		- Plot: Top 20 by year
	√ Make the tables sortable and searchable
