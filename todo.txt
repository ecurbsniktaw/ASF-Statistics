To Do for ASF Stats
===================

- Deploy 1st version
  - Push current code to github
  - Test the deployed version

Changes for next Version:

- When downloading a spreadsheet, if it has been filtered (e.g. stories
  for just one author are being displayed) download just the filtered rows.

- Change the stacked bar chart to a line plot (?)

- Add 1st, last year to heading of plot of stories by one author.

- Consider adding a new display: yr/mo of first appearance
  of each author (and last?)

- In Author Totals table, make the columns more narrow.

- In Authors by month table, make the author column wider.

- Implement the select authors option.

DONE
====

√ Read the two csv files from urls instead of from local files
  (and instead of using AWS storage).

√ pen names to process:
	Will F. Jenkins = Murray Leinster
	long list of SF pen names:
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_science-fiction_authors
	this might be a larger list:
	http://www.scifi.darkroastedblend.com/2007/08/authors-pseudonyms.html
	The routine that creates the allStories csv (and handles pen names):

√ In csv dl: author counts needs to be sorted desc on count
  (same for counts by author/year)
  Maybe stop telling DataTables to sort the data, and just
  sort it while still as a dataframe?

√ Provide download button for tables.

√ For plot by year, one author:
  √ Make all years appear, including when there are zero stories
  √ When no author has been chosen, display a help message.
  √ Eliminate the duplicates in the list: should just
  	be a list of the unique author names (right now has
  	one item for every story)
  √ Ask for the author to use
    √ Show full list as a drop down menu?
  √ Provide a button for downloading the plot to a PDF file

√ Implement top 20 authors.

√ When page first appears, show the full list (before any option
  is chosen).

√ Add a title with stats: # stories, # authors, # issues

√ Implement by year, one author.

√ Try (again) generating the pivot table from the all-stories
  table, instead of reading the pivot csv file. 
  => Didn't work... leaving it as is (reading the file)

√ Implement stacked bar chart.

√ First version: local only
	√ Read the csv from a local file
	√ Extract some/all of the analysis code used in the earlier project.
	√ In the left-side panel, drop down menu:
		- Table: Full listing
		- Table: Author counts
		- Table: Author pivot
		- Plot: Stacked bar chart
		- Plot: By Year, 1 Author
		- Plot: Select authors
		- Plot: Top 20 by year
	√ Make the tables sortable and searchable

AWS Storage Info
================
- Find out how to read in an external csv file from a python script.
	. I created an AWS S3 bucket named sf-data-files-2026 and uploaded
	  the astounding_contents.csv file to that bucket.

Docs for connecting to AWS S3 from a streamlit app running in the streamlit
cloud: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases/aws-s3

My AWS console: 
https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-2

To log into my AWS account, do this in a terminal window:
aws login

My AWS region is us-east-2
