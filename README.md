Data Analysis of Stories Published in Astounding SF 1939 to 1960

This project provides data visualization for the stories published in
Astounding Science Fiction during the Golden Age of the 1940s and 1950s.

The golden age of pulp science fiction is generally agreed to have started in 
the late 1930s when John W. Campbell became editor of Astounding Science Fiction. 

There is less agreement as to the end of that era, but this web page uses the 
July 1939 and September 1960 issues of Astounding as bookends for the golden age. 

The July 1939 issue included both the first published story by A. E. van Vogt, 
"Black Destroyer", and Isaac Asimov's first appearence in Astounding with "Trends". 
Robert Heinlein's first story, "Life-Line", appeared in August, and September saw 
Theodore Sturgeon's first SF story, "Ether Breather".

The data used here is taken from a web page created by Andrew May:
